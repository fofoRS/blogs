# BLOGS REPOSITORY

This repo is intended to be used as a shared space for the 
source code that I would be using to support the blogs created.

###  Repository Structure

The goal is that each submodule relates to a created or future blog.
This main README file will serve as entry point to show as general information
about each submodule folder and to help on the navigation through them.

### SUB-MODULES

####  Spring-boot-docker-local-development

Small project that shows how to setup a local development environment with Docker
and Spring boot. Simulating a microservices architecture style using some components such as
a **discovery-service** and **api-gateway** as architectural components.
